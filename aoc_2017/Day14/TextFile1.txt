Self-contained does not mean that you need no external knowledge of algorithms. 
To solve day 14 you need to know two things: knothhash (presented in day 10 and 
linked in the puzzle description) and a 4-way flood fill (a well known algorithm, 
iff you had to use it before). I see no problem here.

FloodFill algorithms - recursion(overflowable) or stack(better)

Also good options on using grid of tuples instead of a separate grid.  Or use a separate hashset with a string of format "{0},{1}" for "x,y".
