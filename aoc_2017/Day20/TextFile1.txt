Day 20 with calculus (self.adventofcode)

submitted 5 days ago by glenbolake

After doing the iterative solution that most people came up with, I wanted to try and solve day 20 with math. After all, this should be a simple case of pos(t) = 1/2*a*t^2 + v*t + p. We can choose a t that's sufficiently high based on the initial values for part 1, then find collision times for part 2 by combining particles and solving for zero.

This gave me some trouble at first, because of the "increase velocity then position" aspect; the standard kinematic equations don't apply. After putting values for 0<t<12 for a random point into a table, I found the position equation is actually this:

pos(t) = p + vt + t(t+1)/2*a
i.e., acceleration is actually based on triangular numbers.

Part 1
I took the Manhattan-distance magnitude of all particles' initial accelerations, multiplied by 100, and used that for t. In my case, that gave t = 6700, which is more than enough. The answer was solidified by t=359 for my input.

Part 2
Naturally, it gets a little more complicated here. But not much.

For each pair of particles, I created a new fake particle that was the difference between them. e.g., two of my particles were

p=<1381, -388, -404>, v=<-175, 24, 29>, a=<7, 2, 2>
p=<-144, -1008, -374>, v=<5, 163, 59>, a=<2, -12, -4
And this became

p=<1525, 620, -30>, v=<-180, -139, -30>, a=<5, 14, 6>
I then took the three pva tuples and solved for zero. The p(t) above is quadratic with p(t) = a/2*t^2 + (v+a/2)t + p. So for these two points:

1/2*5*t^2 + (-180+5/2)t + 1525 = 0 --> t = 10, 61
1/2*14*t^2 + (-139+14/2)t + 620 = 0 --> t = 8.857142857, 10
1/2*6*t^2 + (-30-6/2)t - 30 = 0 --> t = -1, 10
All three of these have +10 in the solution, so they collide at t=10.

I then had to step through the collisions in order, making sure to remove particles as necessary. This was tricky. Consider:

t=1: A collides with B
t=3: A collides with C, D collides with E
In this case, we would remove A and B at t=1, then remove D and E at t=3, but not C because A was no longer there for it to collide with.

The position of a particle can be calculated as: p = p0 + v0t + at*t/2

"In the long run" means that t goes infinitely up. Which means that the coefficient before t*t is the only one that matters (acceleration). In other words, the particle with the lowest absolute acceleration (which in this case - Manhattan distance - is defined as abs(ax) + abs(ay) + abs(az)) will remain closest to the center (0,0,0).

In case of a tie (more than one particles have the minimal absolute value of the acceleration), the one with the lowest absolute initial speed will be the closest.

In case of yet another tie, the particle with the lowest absolute initial position will be the closest.
